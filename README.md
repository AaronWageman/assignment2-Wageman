### Favorite place to buy food: California Taco Shop

The shop is located just off the **interstate**. There is also a **Popeyes** right next to it. Down the street there is a **Whataburger**. There is also a **car wash down the street**. The shop is backed up by a subdivision.

### Algorithm Code

> Given a set of points in the plane. the convex hull of the set is the smallest convex polygon that contains all the points of it. Using Grahamâ€™s scan algorithm, we can find Convex Hull in O(nLogn) time.

Description from <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convex-hull-set-2-graham-scan/>

```
struct pt {
    double x, y;
};

int orientation(pt a, pt b, pt c) {
    double v = a.x*(b.y-c.y)+b.x*(c.y-a.y)+c.x*(a.y-b.y);
    if (v < 0) return -1; // clockwise
    if (v > 0) return +1; // counter-clockwise
    return 0;
}

bool cw(pt a, pt b, pt c, bool include_collinear) {
    int o = orientation(a, b, c);
    return o < 0 || (include_collinear && o == 0);
}
bool collinear(pt a, pt b, pt c) { return orientation(a, b, c) == 0; }

void convex_hull(vector<pt>& a, bool include_collinear = false) {
    pt p0 = *min_element(a.begin(), a.end(), [](pt a, pt b) {
        return make_pair(a.y, a.x) < make_pair(b.y, b.x);
    });
    sort(a.begin(), a.end(), [&p0](const pt& a, const pt& b) {
        int o = orientation(p0, a, b);
        if (o == 0)
            return (p0.x-a.x)*(p0.x-a.x) + (p0.y-a.y)*(p0.y-a.y)
                < (p0.x-b.x)*(p0.x-b.x) + (p0.y-b.y)*(p0.y-b.y);
        return o < 0;
    });
    if (include_collinear) {
        int i = (int)a.size()-1;
        while (i >= 0 && collinear(p0, a[i], a.back())) i--;
        reverse(a.begin()+i+1, a.end());
    }

    vector<pt> st;
    for (int i = 0; i < (int)a.size(); i++) {
        while (st.size() > 1 && !cw(st[st.size()-2], st.back(), a[i], include_collinear))
            st.pop_back();
        st.push_back(a[i]);
    }

    a = st;
}
